# QUANTIUM - DATA - ANALYTICS

## TASK 1 â€“ RETAIL STRATEGY AND ANALYTICS

This task consists of 2 datasets, the transaction data and customer purchase behaviors data. I was tasked with cleaning and exploring the 2 datasets before aggregating the 2 datasets and analyzing the data to check for trends and insights from the customer purchase behaviors.

## Data Cleaning

1. **Transaction Data Dataset**

The following are the data-cleaning steps I took to ensure the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis:

* Changed the datatype of the DATE column from int64 to DateTime.
* Deleted salsa products from the data which are not chips by checking the most common words and how many times the words appear in the PROD_NAME column.
* Created a new column for chip package sizes, PACK_SIZE_GRAMS, by extracting the pack size data from the PROD_NAME column.
* Created a new column for the chip brands, BRAND, by extracting the brand names from the PROD_NAME column. I then cleaned the BRAND column by checking for spelling mistakes in the brand names and correcting them.
* Checked for outliers in the data by looking at the data summary statistics. I deleted the data that was a possible outlier in the dataset.

2. **Customer Data Dataset**

The following are the data-cleaning steps I took to ensure the data was accurate, consistent, and ready for analysis:
* Checked and ensured that there was no nulls in the dataset that could affect our analysis

I then merged the 2 datasets and exported the resulting file into an Excel worksheet, customer_transaction_data, ready for analysis and visualization. 

## Data Analysis

The following are the guiding questions I had to identify trends and insights in the data:

1. How many customers are in each segment? 
2. Who spends the most on chips (total sales)? 
3. What is the relationship between total sales and customer segments and the number of customers per customer segment?
4. How many chips are bought per customer by segment?
5. What is the relationship between total chip purchases vs all customer segments combined?
6. What's the average chip price by customer segment?

I then did a deep dive into the mainstream- young singles/couples customer segment to understand their purchase behaviours to generate insights and give recommendations on how to do more marketing targeting this segment to maximize sales in this category.
